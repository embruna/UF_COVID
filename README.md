Analysis of UF Covid Data

UF Covid data are being scraped by an annonymous person [into a google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18AylEt8G7JF5LZ9A5QQJ3KjvYfr5ZBfZ8g7jFZ8eZ6A/edit#gid=0). This repo includes code to pull in that google sheet, organize it, and conduct calculations and visualization of COVID trends at UF.  

Here is a tutorial for [how to make a Hopkins-style Covid-dashboard](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/ops-dashboard/health/arcgis-dashboards-training-videos-for-covid-19/).
